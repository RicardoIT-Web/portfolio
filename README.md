### Welcome to my portfolio.

I know, I know, you might be thinking, well...there's not a lot of projects here!

Well thats because I've only just started coding. But look at what I have managed to achieve in 12 months. I am absolutely thrilled with this and I have come a long way from where I was only 1 year ago.

I really hope you can see the content and perhaps we might be able to work together at some point?

Thanks for visiting. Enjoy the app and I hope to hear from you.

Regards

Ricardo
